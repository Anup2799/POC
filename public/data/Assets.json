This airdrop PoC that is developed on a permissionless blockchain, provides NFT creators with a way to reward their most dedicated supporters by distributing NFTs from their collections via the blockchain.\n\nIn addition, the PoC allows users the option to create their own NFT collections. It also allows enthusiasts to join waiting lists for these collections, where the top 10 individuals in each list receive the NFTs.
